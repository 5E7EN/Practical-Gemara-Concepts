# 3 Conclusions

TODO: Rename title for clarity.  
After analyzing a case, the Gemara will come to 3 possible conclusions (in ascending order of precedence).  
If one conclusion is matched, you do not contemplate to the next:

1. [Halacha MiSinai](#halacha-misinai)
2. [Logic](#logic)
3. ?

## Halacha MiSinai

Ideas that have been passed down through the generations from Sinai.

## Logic

Conclusions derived from logical evaluation.
