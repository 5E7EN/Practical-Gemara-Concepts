# Practical Gemara Concepts

## About

Pseudocode and abstractions based on practical Gemara concepts to assist the developer mind - open to contribution.  
Code is structured as-is, not with the intention to compile.

## Structure

Resolutions should be an interface. Conclusions that require logic to be fulfilled, should have a function that implements the interface.
